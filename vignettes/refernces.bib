in two variables is more complicated in nonlinear models than in linear models.
The command inteff computes the correct marginal effect of a change in two
interacted variables for a logit or probit model, as well as the correct standard
errors. The inteff command graphs the interaction effect and saves the results
to allow further investigation.},
