# Technical Implementation Details #

This vignette walks through some of the technical details behind the **margins** package, namely the statistical foundations for the quantities of interest being reported, the reasons for being interested in those quantities, and the computational details for how those quantities and their variances are calculated.

## Statistical Background ##


## Quantities of Interest ##

AMEs versus MEMs versus MERs


## Computation Details ##

 - Symbolic derivatives of formulae
 - Delta method variances
 - GLMs!?
