# margins #

**margins** is an effort to port Stata's (closed source) [`margins`](http://www.stata.com/help.cgi?margins) command to R as an S3 generic method for calculating the marginal effects of coefficients from modelling objects (like those of classes "lm" and "glm"). A plot method for the new "margins" class additionally ports the `marginsplot` command.

Note: While `margins` also implements fitted values from model estimation results, that functionality is already well-implemented by R's `predict` function, so that wheel is not reinvented here.

Bigger note: This is a work-in-progress. Trust nothing.

## Motivation ##

With the introduction of Stata's `margins` command, it has become incredibly simple to estimate average marginal effects, marginal effects at means, and marginal effects at representative cases. R has no comparable functionality in the base tools (though `predict` implements much of the functionality of Stata's `margins`), nor do any add-on packages implement appropriate marginal effect estimates.

Notably, several packages provide estimates of marginal effects for different types of models. Among these are [car](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/car/index.html), [alr3](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/alr3/index.html), [mfx](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/mfx/index.html), [erer](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/erer/index.html), among others. Unfortunately, none of these packages implement marginal effects correctly (i.e., correctly account for interrelated variables such as interaction terms (e.g., `a:b`) or power terms (e.g., `I(a^2)`) and the packages all implement quite different interfaces for different types of models.

Given the importance of non-additive models in all statistical analyses and the difficulty of interpreting those models, there is a clear need for a simple, consistent way to estimate marginal effects for popular statistical models.

This package aims to correctly calculate marginal effects that include complex terms and provide a uniform interface for doing those calculations. Thus, the package implements a single S3 generic method (`margins`) that can be easily generalized for any type of model implemented in R.

## Requirements and Installation ##

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/leeper/margins.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/leeper/margins)

**margins** will eventually be available on [CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/margins/index.html), so that it can be installed using:

```
install.packages('margins')
```

The development version can be installed directly from GitHub using `devtools`:

```
if(!require('devtools')) {
    install.packages('devtools')
    library('devtools')
}
install_github('leeper/margins')
```
