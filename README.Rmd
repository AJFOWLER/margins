# margins #

**margins** is an effort to port Stata's (closed source) [`margins`](http://www.stata.com/help.cgi?margins) command to R as an S3 generic method for calculating the marginal effects of coefficients from modelling objects (like those of classes "lm" and "glm"). A plot method for the new "margins" class additionally ports the `marginsplot` command.

Note: While `margins` also implements fitted values from model estimation results, that functionality is already well-implemented by R's `predict` function, so that wheel is not reinvented here.

Bigger note: This is a work-in-progress. Trust nothing.

## Requirements and Installation ##

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/leeper/margins.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/leeper/margins)

**margins** will eventually be available on [CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/margins/index.html), so that it can be installed using:

```
install.packages('margins')
```

The development version can be installed directly from GitHub using `devtools`:

```
if(!require('devtools')) {
    install.packages('devtools')
    library('devtools')
}
install_github('leeper/margins')
```
